# tigergraph-clinical-lab
Sample training lab to demonstrate clinical graph queries

This is a repository of tools to teach TigerGraph GSQL using synthetic clinical data generated by the Synthia system.

Synthia geerates the following files:

```
     573 allergies.csv
   12126 careplans.csv
   20524 claims.csv
    7041 conditions.csv
   20525 encounters.csv
   13190 immunizations.csv
    6049 medications.csv
   79675 observations.csv
    1463 patients.csv
   10185 procedures.csv
  171351 total
  ```

These files are loaded into TigerGraph using the Giraffle framework.

A few items we are trying to teach in this class:

Naming Conventions

Use Upper Camel Case for Vertex Names
Vertex names should be singular (Patient, not Patients)
Use Lower Camel Case for properties
Use Upper Case for Edge types.
Use ISO Naming conventions - always end with a Representation Term
All Codes should use the STRING COMPRESSED format
